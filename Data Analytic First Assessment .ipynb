    "#Features in Python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. Easy to code\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Large Standard Library \n",
    "Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in Python such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Easy to Read\n",
    "As you will see, learning Python is quite simple. As was already established, Python’s syntax is really straightforward. The code block is defined by the indentations rather than by semicolons or brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Object-Oriented Language\n",
    "One of the key features of Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, object encapsulation, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. High-Level Language\n",
    "Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in Python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Large Community Support\n",
    "Python has gained popularity over the years. Our questions are constantly answered by the enormous StackOverflow community. These websites have already provided answers to many questions about Python, so Python users can consult them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Easy to Debug\n",
    "Excellent information for mistake tracing. You will be able to quickly identify and correct the majority of your program’s issues once you understand how to interpret Python’s error traces. Simply by glancing at the code, you can determine what it is designed to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Python is a Portable language\n",
    "Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have Python code for Windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Python is an Integrated language\n",
    "Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrate Python with other languages like C, C++, etc.\"\"\""

    "Identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Objects: The identity (memory location) of the object remains the same after modification.\n",
    "Immutable Objects: The identity changes if you \"modify\" the object, as a new object is created.\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Objects: Useful when you need to maintain a collection of items that may change, such as lists, dictionaries, or sets.\n",
    "Immutable Objects: Useful for fixed data that should not change, such as configuration constants, keys in dictionaries (tuples), or when working with functional programming paradigms.\n",

    "    if-elif-else statement\n",
    "    Nested if statements\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. The if Statement\n",
    "The if statement is the simplest form of a conditional statement. It tests a condition, and if the condition evaluates to True, the block of code under the if statement is executed.\n",
    "        age = 18\n",

    "\n",
    "3. The if-elif-else Statement\n",
    "The if-elif-else statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check.\n",
    "The elif keyword stands for \"else if\" and allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute the corresponding block of code for the first condition that evaluates to True.\n",
    "If none of the conditions are true, the else block is executed.\n",

    "Therefore, the message \"Grade: B\" is printed. If none of the conditions were true, the else block would execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Nested if Statements\n",
    "You can also use an if statement inside another if statement, creating nested conditional statements. This allows for more complex decision-making structures.\n",
    "        num = 10\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the first if statement checks if num is positive.\n",
    "Since num is 10, the condition is true, and \"The number is positive.\" is printed. Then, the nested if statement checks if num is even. Since 10 is even, \"The number is even.\" is printed."

    "# Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Loops in Python are control structures that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met.\n",
    "They are essential for tasks that require iteration, such as processing items in a list, performing repeated calculations, or automating repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Loops in Python\n",
    "    while loop\n",
    "    for loop\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
    "It's generally used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on the condition being evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code block to execute\n",
    "        count = 1\n",
    "        while count <= 5:\n",
    "            print(\"Count is:\", count)\n",
    "            count += 1\n",
    "        Count is: 1\n",
    "        Count is: 2\n",
    "        Count is: 3\n",
    "        Count is: 4\n",
    "        Count is: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: The while loop is ideal for situations where you want to continue looping until a certain condition changes,\n",
    "such as waiting for user input, processing data until it’s fully processed, or repeatedly checking a condition in a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. for Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects (such as a range of numbers). \n",
    "It’s typically used when the number of iterations is known or when you want to iterate over a specific collection of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "        for variable in sequence:\n",
    "            # Code block to execute\n",
    "        fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "        for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "            print(\"I like\", fruit)\n",
    "        I like apple\n",
    "        I like banana\n",
    "        I like cherry\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. break, continue, and pass Statements in Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "break: Exits the loop prematurely, regardless of the loop’s condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "        for i in range(10):\n",
    "            if i == 5:\n",
    "                break\n",

    "        Copy code\n",
    "        0\n",
    "        1\n",
    "        2\n",
    "        3\n",
    "        4\n",
    "continue: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "        for i in range(5):\n",
    "            if i == 2:\n",

    "        1\n",
    "        3\n",
    "        4\n",
    "pass: Does nothing and is used as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but you don’t want any code to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "        for i in range(5):\n",
    "            if i == 2:\n",
    "                pass\n",
